This code runs a client and a server to transfer the data from client to server
using reliable TCP on top of java built in UDP.

1. When running TCPend please use "tcp/TCPEnd" because the Makefile
produces the class file inside the tcp folder, which is inside the src folder.
For ex)  
    Client - java tcp/TCPend -p <port> -s <remote-IP> -a <remote-port> -f <filename> -m <mtu> -c <sws>
    Server - java tcp/TCPend -p <port> -m <mtu> -c <sws>"

2. The server does not receive a file name from the client. Whenever we sent a
file name to the server, it failed to create the file with the provided file
name due to an invalid path error (even though it appeared correct). Therefore, 
the server writes the received file data to an output file "result.txt" in the
src folder.

3. We set listening port = remote Port for the server. We weren't able to find
a way to determine what port the client was listening on through Java's
functions for Datagrams and Datagramsockets. 

4. Makefile has to be inside the 'src/' folder for the "make" command to work.
